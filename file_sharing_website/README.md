Worked with a partner to create a file sharing website. It allows users to login and view files either they uploaded themselves or that were sent to them by other users.
Users can also delete files as well as new users can register for a new account or delete an existing account.

The site was built in PHP and implemented an AWS instance in order to run it publically.
